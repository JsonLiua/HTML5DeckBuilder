# HTML5 Magic The Gathering Deck Builder

This is a deck builder written with HTML and JS.  I wrote it because I wanted a
deck builder, and I wanted to practice JS.  This app does not use Ember or
Angular, mainly because I don't know how to use them.

## Features

* Drag cards to the board
* Drag cards to the trash
* Stats update automatically
* Save decks in LocalStorage (they are stored on your machine)

## Bugs

* The code is not awesome
* HYPGEOMDIST returns different values than my R / Ruby versions. I think due to
  floating point problems.
* Probably lots more

## Contributing

* *Do not* file bugs (I know it has bugs, I will fix the ones that bother me)
* *Do* file pull requests
* Only use stdlib Ruby
* *Do not* add a `Gemfile`, `travis.yml`, etc
